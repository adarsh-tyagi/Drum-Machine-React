# Drum Machine 
- This simple and interactive app is developed in react. User can press the buttons and can listen the music notes corresponding to that button.
- User can adjust the volume, change the sound bank and can turn it off and on.
- Tried to built it responsive, can be used in mobiles and large screens but I recommend PC screen.
- To rum this app locally use command ->
### npm start
          
## This app is hosted on heroku.
